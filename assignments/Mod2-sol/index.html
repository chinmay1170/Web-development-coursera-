<p2>Okay, so I'm back in my Mac and I'm actually looking at github.com. And I'm already logged in into GitHub. So the first thing we're going to do is we're going to go over how to create your own repository on GitHub. And then how to turn that repository into something you could store your code in your website code in. And then have that same repository turn around and host your website for you. As part of this demonstration, I'm obviously going to use some git commands in order to commit, in order to save, and in order to upload our code that is locally in our machine to github.com. </p2> </section1>
